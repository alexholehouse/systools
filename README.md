*General tools for doing stuff*

**systools** is my repo of general tools for doing general things in Linux. 

Typically a lot of these are stand alone scripts which I've written to achieve specific goals. By putting them in one place it helps keep things tidy, as well as avoid re-inventing the wheel.

Many, if not all of these scripts are based on ideas I've probably got from Stackoverflow/Serverfault/general online discussion. Where appropriate, specific discussions or posts will be referenced for future reading.

For licensing information see LICENSE.txt, but it's MIT, so, you know, do whatever you want.
